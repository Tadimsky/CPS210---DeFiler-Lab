# Implementation details
####################################

This section should contain the implementation details and a overview of the
results. 

You are required to provide a good README document along with the
implementation details. In particular, you can pseudocode to describe your
implementation details where necessary. However that does not mean to
copy/paste your Java code. Rather, provide clear and concise text/pseudocode
describing the primary algorithms (for e.g., scheduling choices you used) and
any special data structures in your implementation. We expect the design and
implementation details to be at most 2-3 pages. A plain textfile is encouraged.
However, a pdf is acceptable. No other forms are permitted.

In case of lab is limited in some functionality, you should provide
the details to maximize your partial credit.
